# Servirtium demo for Javascript

This repo is following the guide at https://github.com/servirtium/README/blob/master/starting-a-new-implementation.md 

- currently, step 2 is partially complete. One test where a nascent Servirtium is purporting to do playback is working, but that's a cheat as it has a hard coded result, and if the other five tests were activated they'd fail.

## Yarn installs

```
yarn add --dev jest
```
